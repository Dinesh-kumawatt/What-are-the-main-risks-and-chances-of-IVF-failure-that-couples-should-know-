IVF, while highly effective, does not guarantee pregnancy and carries some risk of failure. Understanding these risks is crucial for managing expectations. Factors such as age (especially for women over 35), poor egg or sperm quality, underlying health conditions like PCOS or endometriosis, and embryo implantation issues can all affect IVF outcomes. Additionally, chromosomal abnormalities in embryos may lead to unsuccessful implantation or early miscarriage.

Ayuh Fertility Centre believes in complete transparency about IVF success rates and risks. They educate couples on lifestyle changes, advanced techniques like genetic screening (PGT), and endometrial receptivity testing that can help reduce the chances of failure. Ayuhâ€™s approach includes personalized stimulation protocols and embryo selection to maximize success. Their holistic strategy ensures patients are well-informed and emotionally prepared before beginning treatment.
